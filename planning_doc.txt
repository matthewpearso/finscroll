Metrics and Graphs to use:
- Wage growth housing cost graph
- number of workers per household over time
- Mortgage burden visualization?
- Wealth gap animation and scatterplot
- median homebuyer age
- median student loan amount
- college vs non-college unemployment rates

Step 1: Wage vs Housing Line Graph
Median Household Income and Median Sales Price of Houses Sold

Step 2: Workers Per Household
(more data cleanup, same chart type)

Step 3: College vs Non-College Unemployment
(two datasets, dual lines — good practice)

Step 4: Median Homebuyer Age
(cleaner dataset, simple)

Step 5: Student Loan Amount
(another simple line)

Step 6: Mortgage Burden Calculation
(compute monthly payment — new technical skill)

Step 7: Wealth Gap Animation
(hardest: animation + scatter or bar race)
