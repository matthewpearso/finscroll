      <p>This chart compares median household income (blue line) to median home sale prices (red line) over time.</p>

      <p>This chart shows unemployment rates for college educated individuals ages 20-24 (blue line) compared to the overall rate of unemployment, nationwide (red line).</p>
      <p>The unemployment rate of college students and recent graduates fluctuates greatly by season, but historically oscillating around the overall rate of unemployment.</p>
      <p>However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate for college students and recent graduate age 20-24 has consistently stayed above the overall rate of unemployment. This indicates that recent graduates are facing more challenges in finding employment compared to the general population.</p>

      <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        The widening gap between wages and housing costs, coupled with rising debt levels and challenging employment prospects for recent graduates, paints a concerning picture of financial stability in the U.S. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These factors contribute to increased financial stress for many Americans, making it harder to achieve economic security and long-term prosperity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding these trends is essential for policymakers, educators, and individuals alike to address the root causes and work towards solutions that promote financial well-being. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring that individuals and families can achieve economic security and prosperity.
